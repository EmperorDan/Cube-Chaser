# Cube Chaser

## Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a web based game. There are two characters: the player, and the enemy npc. The aim of the game is to keep your character away from the enemy, until a timer concludes. The player has three lives, if the enemy NPC hits the player they lose a life. When the player runs out of lives, the game ends. 

## Mechanics

-Player Character tracks player mouse co-ordinates.

-Enemy NPC follows player mouse.

-Player has 3 lives.

-If player runs out of lives the game ends.

-Player will win if they survive a certain amount of time without being hit.
