## Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a web based game. There are two characters: the player, and the enemy npc. The aim of the game is to keep your character away from the enemy, until a timer concludes. The player has three lives, if the enemy NPC hits the player they lose a life. When the player runs out of lives, the game ends.

Jscript must be completed in notepad for later comparison
## High-level Description:
A non-playing character NPC (that is a character controlled by the computer) targets the users mouse position as the player moves across the screen, the game is over once the NPC touches the players mouse position 3 times. 


## Mechanics

- Player Character tracks player mouse co-ordinates.

- Enemy NPC follows player mouse.

- Player has 3 lives.

- If player runs out of lives the game ends.

- Player will win if they survive a certain amount of time without being hit.

## Difficulties & solutions
- I had trouble getting the Player box (green) to follow the users mouse. To get this to work i searched online for a solution. I eventually found that someone had posted a question to a forum. They asked how they would be able to get an image to follow the users mouse on their website. I took code that was given as an answer and disected it. I gained a better understanding of how to track the mouse co-ordinates. In the end i managed to edit, and incorporate it, into my game code. 
- I am still struggling to incorporate enemy ai into my game. [to be updated]
